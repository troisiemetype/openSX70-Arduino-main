// Meter deals with integrated lightmeter.
// These functions are to be defined for each specific meter chip that is used on the board.
// They will implement whatever is needed for this chip to provide the needed data.
// note : as they are hardware-specific implemented, there is no meter.cpp file.

// As we are in the developing process, their argument may evolve, as well as their return type.

// Self-explanatory : do whatever is needed for the chip to run on startup :
// Pin enable, one-wire / I2C / SPI interface initialisation
extern void meter_init();

// give the sensitivity to the meter
extern void meter_set_iso(uint16_t const& iso);

// compute the time needed for current ligth condition
// so it can be display as an indication in the viewfinder
extern void meter_compute();

// start an integration cycle for auto exposure
extern void meter_integrate();

// get the update from the sensor. When enough light has reached the film, returns true.
extern bool meter_update();

// preprocessor conditionnal inlusion for specific chip header file.
