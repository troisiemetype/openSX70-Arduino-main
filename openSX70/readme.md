# openSX70

##structure fork

This fork is intended to propose a clear structure for the **openSX70** project, to improve both readability and future improvements.
This should help people to get involved into the global project or on specific parts, for bug fixing or global improvement.
This should also make integration of future features easier, by separating logic from hardware as much as possible, and by creating dedicated files for hardware, timers, inputs, dongle, etc.
