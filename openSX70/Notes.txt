Todo list !

Must be done :

- Remove all delay() : delay() is a blocking function, it literraly uses the CPU for nothing. Create a non-blocking timer function with polling instead, or an interrupt-based timer.

Could be done :
- Remove the use of tone. I've read somewhere that it is quite heavy. Indeed it seems to be.
- Create faster / lighter functions for digital pin handling (Arduino core functions do checkups each time they are used).
