Notes, questions !

*
In setup, what is the purpose of the Picture struct ? I understand it is intended for storing picture parameters, but some are not directly linked to the picture ?

*
What are the values to be stored in eeprom ? I understand each picture parameters are stored and can be exported once the pack is over ?
