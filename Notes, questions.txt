Notes, questions !

*
In setup, what is the purpose of the Picture struct ? I understand it is intended for storing picture parameters, but some are not directly linked to the picture ?

*
What are the values to be stored in eeprom ? I understand each picture parameters are stored and can be exported once the pack is over ?

*
What are flash mode ?
Flashbar is quite obvious, it's the original flash to be mounted in the socket. Auto-exposure and fixed shutter speed.
DongleFlash is flash connected to the dongle, with mechanical auto-exposure (solenoid S2) and focus compensation. (and fixed shutter speed ?)
DongleFlashF8 is for flash connected to the dongle, without auto-exposure. Could be used with fill-in flash and light integration ?

*
See what kind of flag system can be made so ISR in lightmeter-specific chip can be read from the main loop

*
About flash, and dongle flash : could it be possible to reuse FFA for dongle flash triggering ? It could be made by simply connecting a mosfet to the first available pin, and add a optoisolator ?
